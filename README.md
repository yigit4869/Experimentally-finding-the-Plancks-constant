# Course Project for PHYS-212
Bilkent PHYS-212 Course project
We conducted a project aimed at determining Planck's constant through a multi-slit experiment utilizing a diffraction grating. By measuring the energy of light using LEDs and a multimeter, and calculating the frequency of light from the diffraction patterns, we equalized these values to isolate and determine Planck's constant. This experiment, performed with red, blue, and green light, enabled us to compare and validate our results against theoretical values, showcasing the reliability and precision of our approach.
